# Formal-simulation-and-visualisation-of-hybrid-programs

## Abstract:
The design and analysis of systems that combine computational, discrete
behaviour with physical processes' continuous dynamics -- such as movement,
velocity, and voltage -- is a famous, challenging task.  Several theoretical
results from programming theory emerged in the last decades to tackle the
issue; some of which are the basis of a \emph{proof-of-concept} tool, called
Lince, that aids in the analysis of such systems, by presenting simulations of
their respective behaviours.

Being a proof-of-concept, the tool is quite limited w.r.t.  usability, and when
attempting to apply it to a set of common, concrete problems, involving
autonomous driving and others, it either simply cannot simulate them or fails
to provide a satisfactory user-experience.

% Solution
This work thus complements the aforementioned theoretical approaches with a more
practical perspective by improving Lince along several dimensions: to name a
few, richer syntactic constructs, more operations, more informative plotting
systems and errors messages, and a better performance overall.
% Validation
We illustrate our improvements via a variety of examples that involve both
autonomous driving and electrical systems.
